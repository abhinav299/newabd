It allows multiple developers to work together


             Features of Git

1 Tracks history
2 Free and open source
3 Supports non-linear development
4 Creates backups
Scalable
5 Supports collaboration
6 Branching is easier
7 Distributed development

The Git workflow is divided into three states:

Working directory - Modify files in your working directory

Staging area (Index) - Stage the files and add snapshots of them to your staging area

Git directory (Repository) - Perform a commit that stores the snapshots permanently to your Git directory.

Checkout any existing version, make changes, stage them and commit.

MAVEN ---Maven is a build tool for Java-based applications. 
Using Maven we can automate application code compilation and Build process. 
Maven is one of the core tools in the gamut of DevOps practices.
Its very important for DevOps Engineers to learn Maven to understand end to end Build,
packaging and deployment process.

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration system for automating software deployment,

 scaling
 a Originally designed by Google,
 the project is now maintained by the Cloud Nativâ€¦

Kubernator is an alternative Kubernetes UI. 
In contrast to high-level Kubernetes Dashboard, 
it provides low level control and clean view on all objects in a cluster with the ability to create new ones, 
edit and resolve conflicts.
